# Proof of Reputation Smart Contract

This repository contains the Solidity source code for the **Proof of Reputation (PoR)** protocol developed by Blocryp. PoR is an innovative on-chain reputation scoring mechanism designed to empower decentralized identity, trust, and governance within Web3 fintech ecosystems.

---

## Overview

The PoR smart contract allows secure, transparent management of reputation scores tied to Ethereum addresses. Reputation scores can be incremented, decremented, or reset by authorized entities, enabling robust trust models beyond traditional Proof of Work or Proof of Stake consensus.

---

## Features

- **Secure reputation tracking:** Reputation scores stored and updated on-chain for maximum transparency.  
- **Owner-controlled access:** Only authorized owners can modify reputation, ensuring integrity.  
- **Event logging:** All reputation changes emit detailed events for off-chain indexing and auditing.  
- **Lightweight & extensible:** Simple base contract designed for integration with complex on-chain governance oracles.

---

## Why Proof of Reputation?

- Enhances **decentralized identity** and **trust** in fintech dApps.  
- Provides a scalable alternative to existing consensus mechanisms by factoring reputation.  
- Enables fraud resistance, sybil attack mitigation, and improved user verification.  
- Supports future extensions such as staking, decay, and social graph integration.
